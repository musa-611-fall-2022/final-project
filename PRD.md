# Final-project prd:

## Purpose

Discover locational patterns of major seismic events (earthquakes) around the world. Investigate the relationship between earthquake locations and things like tectonic plates or surrounding terrains.

## Features

This application is mainly going to be displayed as a website with a interative map that shows live time earthquake data. Functions may include:

* Map marker for each earthquakes with
    * Color of the marker showing the depth
    * Size of the marker showing the magnitube
* Clicking the marker will display details including:
    * Location of event
    * Time of occurance
    * Depth of the earthquake
    * Magnitude

To better discover relationship between features like tectonic plates and terrains, the base map is allowed to switch between different layers including:
* Regular Street Map
* Map with satellite view
* Option to include outlines of tectonic plate on the map

## Data

Live feed earthquake Geojson data from United States Geological Survey (https://earthquake.usgs.gov/). 

Also the tectonic plate data is needed.
