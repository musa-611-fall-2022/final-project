# Final Project PRD: Seattle Filipinotown

## Purpose

Encourage the wider community to help in preserving the history and story of Seattle's Filipinotown

## Features

I'm thinking of creating an app that displays the points where there was once a historic Filipino owned establishment within the boundaries of Seattle's Chinatown-International District, which is Filipinotown. With creating this app, people are able to drop points on the map where they can report a business that used to exist or submit recollections of their memories in these spaces. This app can be seen as a tool to preserve history while engage with the commmunity to participate in that process.

* Map marker for each business
* Clicking on a map marker will pop up details about...
  * Business name
  * Type of business
  * Owner
  * Start year
  * Add year
* People can add information such as...
  * The previous aforementioned data
  * Memories
  * Names of people involved with that space
  * Photos

Additional things may include:
* Filtering by business type and years of service
* Adding second set of data to each marker to show what now exists
