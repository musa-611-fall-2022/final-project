# Atlantic Yards/Pacific Park Plans Interactive

This project aims to take a small data set of a 17+ building development and visualize its construction progress and unit counts in a clean display. 

## Audience
  * Journalists, officials, and community leaders who need to keep track of the project for the sake of government accountability.
  * Planners and architects who are in need of better ways than a standard rendering, data tables, and plan views to communicate building contents and progress because their current methods of public communication leave many basic questions unanswered. 
  * Neighbors of the project in Park Slope and Brooklyn who need to know about changes in their community because it affects their daily lives.

## Requirements

1. Load data from CSV on top of background image contained by axon versions of each building.
2. Each building is filled with a proportional amount of teal or red based on the proportion of affordable units in that building.
3. A bar at the bottom of the interactive summarizes the amount of units built and to be built, colored or labeled according to their income-linked designation
4. Mousing over the buildings highlights the active building and displays a tooltip with essential building data and unit affordability tables. 
  * A notes section at the bottom of the tooltip lists any additional information included in the spreadsheet.
5. A set of two buttons filters the graphic based on what is currently built and the approved plans to build.
6. The dataset and information can be edited by simply rewriting the original CSV file. 
7. The interactive should be mobile friendly to the point where information is readable and taps replace mouseover functionality.

### Stretch Goal

8. A third button loads an interactive leaflet map with outlines of each building, complete with the same mouseover functionality.
