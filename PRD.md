# Food-Near-My-Bus

## Purpose

While on the bus (or your choice of transit) in Philadelphia, you get hungry. You decide to grab a quick meal or snack near the place you want to get off at. This app lets you see cafes or restaurants, by category, in a walking distance from the bus stop you want to alight at. 

## Features

This is a mobile friendly app that lets you click on a transit stop in Philadelphia, and see eateries within a walking distance. The points will be filtered by transit stops (bus, regional rail, trolley etc) and type of establishment (fast food/restaurant/coffee shop, type of food, levels of distance from transit stop).

* Markers for every transit stop, colored by type of transit.
* Markers for eateries by different walk distances (3 min, 5 min, 10 min) pop up when transit stop is selected
* Eatery restaurant marker will include name of restaurant when clicked on/hovered over.
* Eateries filtered on the basis of dataset acquired.

## Stretch (Adding new data to the existing dataset for one route):

* Type of food, with a focus on international food (Chinese, Korean, Ethiopian, Indian etc...)
* Type of establishment (restaurant, coffee shop, cafe, take-out only etc...)
* Whether open after 5pm or not
