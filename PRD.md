## Final Project PRD / Ideas
### Idea
For my final project, I would like to make a story map about differing levels of mobility via mode of transit in Philadelphia; this map would pick a specific
location and explore how far you could travel by various modes of transit and explore your level of access to certain types of facilities (e.g. grocery store,
inexpensive restaurant, park, transit connections). I'd also be interested in including a graphic to judge your level of safety along your ride, based on 
crash data or something similar. It would be nice to do this kind of exploration for multiple locations, for example one in a poorer area vs. wealthier or 
more central vs. more suburban, but I would need to judge my capacity while working on the project. 


### Data
- Amenity data: stores, shops, health facilities, ?
  - Source: OpenDataPhilly, Google?
- Safety: crash data, High Injury Network, speed limits, bicycle infrastructure
  - Source: OpenDataPhilly, PennDOT
- Mode of transport: transit lines, bicycle infrastructure, micromobility options, sidewalk conditions, street trees (?)
  - Source: OpenDataPhilly, SEPTA, NJ Transit (possibly)


### Questions/Concerns
- How can I show a route/directionality through a story map?
- Where should I focus around / is this too open-ended?
- How can I judge cost?
- Is there a more useful way to frame this project (perhaps not as an exploration, but a critique)?
