## Purpose

To inform building owners how much money they can save when installing Solar Roofs, and shows the potential of Solar Roofs throughout our community.

## Features

Our application consists of two main pages.
The My Roof Potential page is a main page that provides information about individual buildings, and when you search for an address or click on the roof of a building on a map, you can find information about the Solar Roof.  The My City Potential page configures a dashboard that shows the potential of a Solar Roof installation by city.

#### My Roof Potential
* My Roof Search Box
* Map Marker for each roof
* Summary Box of My roof
  * Address
  * Annual Hours of sunlight
  * Area available for installing solar panel
  * Estimated net profits over 20 years
  * potential environmental impact

#### My City Potential

* My City Lists
* Map of Roof by sunlight hours 
* Dashboard
  * Total Number of Roof available for installing solar panel in our city 
  * Total Area of Roof available for installing solar panel in our city
  * Estimated energy generation, MWh per Year of our city 
  * Distribution of energy potential
  * Estimated net profits over 20 years
  * Potential environmental impact
    
## Problem & Methods

The maps are all based on Mapbox.gl, we have come across several problems and solved them:

* Huge Data: our building geojson data's size is approaching 650Mb, it's too huge to load them into a geojson layer once, so we divided it into seven parts through QGIS and loaded them. We don't use Asynchronous loading.

* Select box doesn't listen to changes from Js, just from the web page, mouse or keyboard. So we added a trigger to attention the change event.

* The geocoder part is from Mapbox, we failed to change the input address when we click the roof polygon in the map. But we have defined a variable to tell the app whether the input address is from the clicked roof polygon or the input box.

One essential thing is that:

Maybe the layout, font size in your personal computer don't show very well. It needs you to adjust your computer's system zoom size in the Setting.

We failed to solve this problem.
