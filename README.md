## Aim:
Using a subset of 311 data, the user will scroll through a pre-determined time period and see when and where 311 requests of various types are filed in Philadelphia, and how they correlate to certain important events during that time period. 

## Steps:
Clean 311 data and aggregate categories into more intuitive buckets.
Design rough mockup.
Build map that hides and shows data based on scroll.
Build chart that indicates user position within the time period and responds to scrolling.
Input cleaned 311 data and debug.
Make it pretty! Style it to match the event.
