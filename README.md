The app PickMe! TM was created by Sofia Fasullo on her own form her MUSA JavaScript class final project. 
We all know that feeling when you scored a date with someone but now have to plan all the details. PickMe is a simple yet elegant app which loads restaurant data from all around Philadelphia's various neighborhoods and allows the user to pick one at random, leaving out the stress of decision making. Depending on the information displayed about the restaurant and whether the user likes that or not, they can choose to run PickMe again or not. And they are able to see parks and farmers markets that may be near their restaurant of (not so stressful) choice.
To use PickMe, all a user has to do is create a free Github, MapBox, and Foursquare account, as download VS code onto their computer. With the github account they can download all the code provide it, open it in VS code and run npx http-server to start a server. In the code they should replace the mapbox and foursquare API tokens in the code with their own personal ones. They can then type http://127.0.0.1:8080/site/ into the browser of their choosing to launch the site, and enjoy!
