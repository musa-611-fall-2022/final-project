# Qualitative Story Map: Product Requirements Document

## Who is it for:

* Primarily for me to be able to share my research
* Community members who are interested in the research project
* Faculty and scholars who are instereted in the research project
* Schools that are hiring a Education Faculty member with GIS and programming experience

## Why do they need it?

GIS has grown in the field of higher education research. Indeed, there are scholars who have implemented geographic methods (Dache-Gerbino, 2016; Tate, 2008); however, GIS is not widely used by the field of higher education research. There are a number of reasons to implement GIS...

1. Makes research more accessible by offering simple visualizations
1. Connects complex and dynamic nature of segregation and integration (Pinto-Coelho & Tufuku, 2015)
1. Provides geographic context areas areas under examiniation.

## What do I propose?

I would like to propose a project that serves two purposes...

1. Show how GIS can be used as a tool for qualitative anaylsis through a story map
1. Show how GIS can be used as a tool for quantitative analysis by providing census tract data that provides context to areas under examination
1. This project can be used for "Job Talks". 

**Features**
* Story map that functions as a "positionality statement", to present my meaning making process
* Each "slide" will have context explaining the map
* The map will pan and zoom to a specific feature
