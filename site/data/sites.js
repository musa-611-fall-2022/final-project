In 1881 Derby and Frederick M. Kilmer formed a partnership for the purpose of manufacturing office furniture. The specialty of the company was in roll top desks. The rapidly expanding business soon forced the company to seek larger quarters in Cambridge, and finally in Somerville where in 1882 a 5-story frame factory (burned 1968) was erected on the site of an old slate quarry, part of the 'Taylor Ledge'. The 2-story brick core of the present factory was built adjacent to this in 1887 along the Boston & Maine Railroad with the remaining 7-story portion built 1895-97. At its height, with sales outlets in cities throughout the country, the company was held to be the largest manufacturing industry in the world devoted exclusively to the manufacture of office furniture. In 1931 the company sold out to Heywood Wakefield Furniture Co. By the 1950's the building was occupied by several small tenants, most of whom had abandoned the building by 1960. In 1973 the Rogers Foam Corp. bought the building, leasing the upper three floors to artists. Two years later the firm renovated the second floor for their own offices.

This organization has roots dating back to 1085 in Malta, an island in the Mediterranean located between Sicily and Tunisia in North Africa. The original mission of the Knights was to provide protection for pilgrims who made their way between Europe and the Holy Land during the Crusades. Over time, the Knights became a multi-chapter charitable organization focused on aiding the poor and the sick within their communities. By the late 19th century, the Knights of Malta had organizations in virtually every part of the U.S. and continued their commitment to help the less fortunate. The Knights of Malta Building was also the first home of Fisher College, which was located on this Square from 1903 to 1939 when it moved to its present location on Beacon Street in Boston’s Back Bay.

This Queen Anne single-family house was built circa 1895 for Laura and Stephen Lewis, a carpenter who worked for Hudson and Lewis, an East Somerville business involved with real estate, insurance, building, hardware and painter supplies. Historic designation is the process by which the City of Somerville officially recognizes the important historical associations and/or architectural features often possessed by buildings over 50 years old. Once designated, alterations to the outside of the property visible from the public way need to be reviewed and approved by the SHPC. By protecting and retaining these aspects of Somerville history, and working with the owners, the City hopes to preserve Somerville's cultural heritage, of which the architecture of the property plays a very important part. Since adoption of an ordinance in 1985, the City has established many Local Historic Districts (LHDs) which can be comprised of both single- or multiple-buildings, each one determined to have historical, social, cultural, or architectural significance. Historically-designated properties are often marked by a white plaque featuring the image of the Old Powder House, the historic name of the house (usually the first owner), and the date of construction.

The Howie house was one of the first non-agricultural buildings constructed on Summer Street and was also built before industry really took off in Somerville. As such, it offers us a glimpse of what the neighborhood looked like as a more rural area, before the Spring Hill building boom in the 1880s-90s. This house was built for John Howie, who worked as a designer in downtown Boston. It remained in the Howie family's possession until the early 1900s. The SHPC gave 170 Summer Street a Preservation Award in 2015.", "yearadded": "2020", "additionalinformation": "", "geom": {"type": "Point", "coordinates":[-71.1067, 42.38644]}},
