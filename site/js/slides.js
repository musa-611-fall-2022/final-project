    I grew up in a subrub of Columbus, Ohio with a fair amount of diversity. <br>
    Although there was a decent amount of diversity, I was still one of only a handful of Asian Americans at my school. Throughout my schooling experience I had understood Asian Americans to be academically high achieving students who excelled in mathematics. Although I did my best to attempt to fulfill this stereotype, I was not the most academically high achieving student.

    The first university I attended was Denison University. This university was tucked into the verdent rolling hills of Granville, Ohio. However this university was far from diverse, and was my first real encounter recognizing that I shared a very different experience from my fellow students. Here I continued to pursue what I thought would allow me to fill the expectation of being Asian American, and studied music composition and chemistry in hopes of one day applying to dental school. <br>
    In considering what it meant for me to be Asian American at the time, I felt pressure to attend a school that was well known and was incredibly selective. While I was rejected from the local public higher education institution, I was accepted by a private liberal arts school. This school was selective; however, very expensive as well. My family could not afford to continue sending me here, and nor did I feel like I belonged at this campus. This was the first experience that I had realizing that as an Asian American I was different.

While Asian Americans have educational success, scholars have also cautioned that a singular narrative of Asian American success invisibilizes the educational outcomes of different ethnic groups in Asian America and puts Asian Americans at odds with other minority groups as the model minority.

    title: 'Asian American Clustering Methodology',
    content: `I use data from the 2019 American Community Survey (ACS), primarily relying on data that describes highest form of education attainment, Asian country of origin, and annual income. These variables were selected using Perna’s (2006) conceptual model of higher education particularly focusing on the school and community context. Broad Asian American racial categories were developed from research that addresses Asian American movements (Nadal, 2019; Yi et al., 2020). <br>
    LISA is defined as having two properties. <br> 
    (1) the LISA for each observation gives an indication of the extent of significant spatial clustering of similar values around that observation and <br>
    (2) the sum of LISAs for all observations is proportional to a global indicator of spatial association. In our case each census block is calculated individually and then summed to provide the I from Moran's I. The calculated LISA describes each blocks effects of the clustering within the data.

    Within Asian American populations there are differences across ethnic group such as information to college access and campus resources (Museus & Truong, 2009; Palmer & Maramba, 2015; O. A. Poon & Byrd, 2013). Teranishi et al. (2004) found in their study that Chinese and Korean Americans had the greatest representation in selective institutions; however, even within ethnic groups there exist differences across socioeconomic status. Because of such cases, scholars and researchers have frequently called for the disaggregation of Asian American data to ensure that ethnic minorities are supported within the Asian American racial category (Museus & Truong, 2009).

    Southeast Asians live in census tracts with significantly more black people, while East Asian and South Asian populations live in areas with significantly more white people. Asian Americans in white spaces is not a new finding, Cheng (2013) found that Asian Americans and Mexican Americans were able to move into white neighborhoods, and transformed these spaces to be multiracial communities. However, these findings also provide geographic context to other studies that argue Asian Americans are nearing “white status” and reinforcing the black and white divide (Bonilla-Silva, 2004; J. C. Lee & Kye, 2016). <br>

    title: 'Ethnic Economies',

    Park (2012) does not dismiss that Asian Americans have high aspirations but tempers the argument by recognizing most racial/ethnic groups have high educational expectations. East Asian Americans have access to structural resources that provide educational gains; for example, a low-income person would still have access to after-school preparatory services, in contrast to low-income Black, Latinx, and White students who may not live near these resources. Using quantitative data from the 1997 Cooperative Institutional Research Program (CIRP), Park used summary statistics and logistic regression models to find that family income is salient in determining access to SAT preparation. Park acknowledges that 1997 may be older; however, it is the only dataset that disaggregated Asian Americans by ethnicity.

    The primary argument used to dismantle affirmative action is that Asian Americans have overcome discrimination, as such there is no longer a need for affirmative action. Rather Asian Americans do not benefit from this, despite multiple studies showing that Asian Americans do benefit from the policy (Kang, 1996; C. J. Kim, 2018; Park & Liu, 2014; Poon et al., 2019). Takagi (1990) examined how discourse and information about Asian American admissions evolved from discrimination against Asian Americans, to diversity in higher education, to how highly qualified Asian Americans are systematically disadvantaged because of affirmative action. <br>

    Takagi’s (1990) examination shows how Asian American discrimination from elite institutions is tied to affirmative action. More importantly, Takagi highlights how systematic quantitative analysis continues to have flaws in its interpretation and warns that the discourse over Asian American admissions will continue.

    At this event I also observed wrote down my memos later and excerpt of my mom has been included below.  
    <i> During my time at the rally, I spent a decent portion of my time holding a banner with the text, “Chinese Americans for Affirmative Action”. People were taking a lot of pictures while students were speaking and doing chants such as, “No justice, no Peace”, and “Hey Hey, Ho Ho, Edward Blum has got to go”. There were also more speakers speaking about the benefits of affirmative action. One of the speakers was the executive director for SEARAC, the southeast Asian advocacy group. Later on, we saw a large group of people standing in a circle across the street. The were silently doing something, so I walked over and saw that they were praying. They went through the Lord’s prayer and then started chanting something along the lines of forgive us of our sins, but I wasn’t able to pick up what they were praying about. </i>
