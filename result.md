Clearly not all of my goals were achieved with this project, however, I successfully:

- created a map displaying data from multiple sources
- used foursquare places API to retrieve restaurant data from a browser
- created a random generator function that identified one restaurant to go to
- created interactive information displays that show which restaurant was randomly selected and information about that
-  colorful markers and tooltips
- colorblind-friendly colors taken from colorsmart palettes

I could not figure out how to use fetch in a way that could produce a data item and not just a promise. As a result, I only worked with the map layer displayed and not the data itself, and could not figure out how to successfully filter the data. With more time, I would:

 - figure out how to create a data feature from the fetch API
 - put filters on attributes of the restaurants
 - get to my original requirements document goals
 - improve the aesthetics of my app
